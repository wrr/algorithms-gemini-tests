Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that can be used to find an element in an array.
It is similar to binary search where we divide the array into two parts but in this algorithm,
we divide the given array into three parts and determine which has the key (searched element).
We can divide the array into three parts by taking mid1 and mid2.
Initially, l and r will be equal to 0 and n-1 respectively, where n is the length of the array.
mid1 = l + (r-l)/3
mid2 = r â€“ (r-l)/3

Note: Array needs to be sorted to perform ternary search on it.
T(N) = O(log3(N))
log3 = log base 3
